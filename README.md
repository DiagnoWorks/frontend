# ⚛️ React + Vite + Tailwind + TypeScript Starter Template

A clean, organized, and scalable starter codebase for building modern React applications using **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**. This setup ensures a clear project structure for faster development, easy maintenance, and better code readability.

## 📁 Project Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the folder structure and its purpose:

   ```bash
   ├── assets/
   
   │ └── # Store images, logos, icons, fonts, or videos used across the app.
   
   │
   ├── components/
   
   │ ├── designs/
   
   │ │ └── Card.tsx # Page-specific UI components like product cards, banners, etc.
   
   │ │
   │ └── layouts/
   
   │ └── Header.tsx # Common layout components that wrap entire pages (headers, sidebars, footers).
   
   │
   ├── hooks/
   
   │ └── # Custom React hooks for reusable logic (e.g., useToggle, useFetch, useDebounce).
   
   │
   ├── lib/
   
   │ ├── axios.ts # Pre-configured Axios instance for API requests (with baseURL and credentials).
   
   │ ├── dummy.ts # Dummy/mock data for development and UI showcasing.
   
   │ └── utils.ts # Utility functions like formatters, helpers, or API clients.
   
   │
   ├── pages/
   
   │ └── # Top-level React page components linked via React Router.
   
   │
   ├── store/
   
   │ └── # Global state management setups (e.g., Zustand, Redux).
   
   │
   ├── types/
   
   │ └── # TypeScript type and interface declarations shared across the app.
   
   │
   ├── index.html
   
   ├── vite.config.ts
   
   ├── package.json
   
   ├── tsconfig.json
   
   └── tailwind.config.ts

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **React**
- **Vite** — for blazing-fast development builds
- **Tailwind CSS** — for utility-first styling
- **TypeScript** — for type safety and better developer experience
- **Axios** — for API requests
- **React Router** — (optional, but recommended for pages routing)
- **Zustand / Redux** — (as global state manager options)

# 📖 Folder Purpose in Detail :-

| Folder        | Description                                                                                                   |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `assets/`     | Store static files like images, icons, fonts, or videos.                                                      |
| `components/` | Contains reusable UI components. Split into `designs/` (page-specific) and `layouts/` (common page wrappers). |
| `hooks/`      | Custom React hooks (e.g., `useToggle`, `useDebounce`, `useFetch`).                                            |
| `lib/`        | Shared utilities, dummy data, and Axios configurations.                                                       |
| `pages/`      | Main pages of your app, routed via React Router.                                                              |
| `store/`      | Global state management setups (Zustand or Redux).                                                            |
| `types/`      | TypeScript type and interface declarations for consistent typing.                                             |
